# Clinic-ASPNet-Core-Web-Client
Application Clinic is used to manage the reception work at the clinic : for adding patients, doctors and visits and managing them. The idea for creating application comes from time when i used to going to allergy clinic and there wasnt any software to keeping records of visits so the lady at the reception desk had to write everything in a notebook. Unfortunately in those days I couldn't do programs so I leave it until 2020. I want create full system which will include WEB client in ASP.NET Core, desktop client in WPF and maybe client for Android. 

This repository will contain a WEB Client part of Clinic system, now it's only start page with login and registration
