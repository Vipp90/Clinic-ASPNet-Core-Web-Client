# Clinic-ASPNet-Core-Web-Client
Application Clinic is used to manage the reception work at the clinic : for adding patients, doctors and visits and managing them. The idea for creating application comes from time when I used to going to allergy clinic and there wasn't any software to keep records of visits so the woman at the reception desk had to write everything in a notebook. Unfortunately in those days I couldn't do programs so I leave it until 2020. I want create full system which will include WEB client in ASP.NET Core, desktop client in WPF and maybe client for Android. 

This repository will contain a WEB Client part of Clinic system, I am constantly working on it, adding new functionalities. Now it's possible to make account and log in, after that as a patient you can make reservation of your visit. For Admin account there are also pages for managing doctors, patients and visits. 

You can check how it works at the address http://89.67.10.25 and login as test@gmail.com with password test. The environment is currently running on my laptop and so can not be always available.

In the nearest future I'm going to learn more html and CSS to improve design of the application.
